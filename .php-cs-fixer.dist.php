/**
 * Formatting is a settled question in this repository, not a per-file
 * judgement call: PER-CS 2.0 (PSR-12's successor) plus a handful of rules
 * that match how the code was already written by hand.
 *
 * The point of having a formatter here at all is that this project exists
 * to be read. A diff should show a change in behaviour, never a change in
 * brace placement.
 *
 * Two conventions no rule can express, so they are written down here:
 *
 *  - A constructor's parameters go one per line with a trailing comma, even
 *    when they would fit on one. Adding or removing a dependency is then a
 *    one-line diff, and a promoted property can carry its own comment.
 *  - Dependencies are promoted, with their default in the signature
 *    (`private readonly Clock $clock = new SystemClock()`), rather than
 *    taken as nullable and resolved in the body. The signature is then the
 *    whole truth about what the object holds, and `readonly` goes on
 *    everything that is never reassigned.
